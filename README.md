# KivyRecordPlayer #

* clean UI
* each folder in the music directory is a "record" to be played by touch
* no playlists 
* no bleedin' shuffle mode

The actual playback is handled by a configurable backend, by default the excellent [Music Player Daemon](https://www.musicpd.org/).

Built using [Kivy](https://kivy.org).
